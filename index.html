                <h2>Why Talibé Children? / Our Story</h2>
                <p>In the Senegalese town of Mboro there is a man called Ibrahim Cisse who has been adopting talibé children since …. He has opened up his modest home and shares his low income with these forgotten Senegalese children, simply to help make their lives a little better. Mr. Cisse currently has over 500 children aged 5 to 16 years living on his property. Having a modest income means that Mr. Cisse can barely afford to feed the children at least one meal a day and it has happened where they go days without a single decent meal. The biggest concern, however, is that they are in desperate need of adequate shelter and especially restrooms/bathrooms.</p>
                <p>By raising funds or having building materials donated, we plan to build some rooms and bathrooms before the end of 2018 where the children can have a place they can call “home”.</p>
                <p>The town of Mboro is about an hour’s drive from Dakar, the capital of Senegal.</p>

                <p>We protect, nurture and educate the abandoned and orphaned children in Senegal, empowering these young lives for the benefit of future generations.</p>

                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Hawa Kader Gaye Dia, our founder and executive director, was first made aware of the significant plight of talibé children in 2010 when her family was on their first pilgrimage to Mecca. Her family’s guide was Ibrahim Cisse’s son who was a student at the time. Several years later in 2015 a news headline caught Hawa’s eye that called her to action: “Big Fire Where Talibés Sleep”. Nine children, ages 6-10, had lost their lives that day.</p>
                <p>Hawa knew immediately that she could not stand by and watch another Senegalese child be hurt. She was called to act upon what she has always believed is her life’s mission: to reach out and make a real difference in the lives of these poor children. She strives to give the talibé children a healthy start to life, giving them the opportunity to learn, and protecting them from harm.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-8">Hawa grew up in Senegal, West Africa, and moved to the USA in 1991 where she attended the University of the District of Columbia and earned her Bachelor’s Degree in Business Management. Hawa also completed advanced degree work in Education, Psychology and School Directorship. Her decades of experience as a teacher sparked a powerful and passionate vision to provide a better life for less fortunate children in Senegal, especially those born with Sickle Cell Anemia. She founded Mathurin Children’s Foundation to educate the world about the challenges these children face and to provide resources that can make a profound difference in their lives. The foundation is named for Hawa’s beloved cousin Mathurin who died of Sickle Cell Anemia at the age of five.
